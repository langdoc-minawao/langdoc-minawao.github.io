Ours is one of the very few, if any, projects of language documentation run in a refugee camp. More ample discussion of the specific challenges posed by such setting will be found in an upcoming publication, which will be referenced here. In this page, we focus on the two main challenges that we encountered, and the possible solutions that we are adopting to cope with them.

## Working in a context of acute lack of resources
At times of reduced humanitarian support and shrinking resources—such as the current context, marked by major cuts in international aid—the presence of Global North external actors in a refugee camp often becomes a practical obstacle to smooth documentary work. Outsiders inevitably introduce perturbations into the local environment and its constituting relationships. This can (and usually does) heighten tensions among project participants.

Although this challenge is not actually addressed in standard language documentation best practices, the only effective way to manage it is to minimize the outsider’s presence during core documentary activities. Doing so requires a robust framework built on four pillars:
- **Meaningful capacity building among camp residents** enabling them to take full ownership of the documentary tasks.
- **Consistent and constructive communication within the team**.
- **Reliable technological infrastructure** ensuring seamless team-wide collaborative work even when some members are dispersed (e.g. see Tech page).
- **A clear, collectively endorsed team structure** with well-defined roles, responsibilities, rights, and transparent decision-making.

This is what genuine community collaboration looks like, and this is what we are trying to build in this project.

## Keeping project outputs local and accessible
Life in a refugee camp is marked by a deep lack—not only of resources, but of the social and cultural structures that normally hold communities together. Communities are separated from their traditions and often their members are even separated from one another, scattered across different sectors of the camp. NGOs and institutions try to ease this vulnerability through an endless stream of projects, each with its own meetings, committees, and targets. Camps' cultural ecologies change constantly: projects start and stop, buildings appear for a purpose and are then repurposed (or abandoned), outside staff come and go.

**In this situation, and with the root causes of displacement left untouched, many people see little real change. Projects are supported through funding that may suddenly end, and often project results remain inaccessible or ephemeral to their participants. In spite of the undoubtedly good intentions animating all of these activities, the unintended "roller-coaster" cycles of enthusiasm and mourning that their participants experience eventually erodes trust and weakens any sense of future—especially among young people.**

This is exactly why the outputs of our project need to be returned to the community quickly and in ways that people can actually use. **If knowledge is collected in the camp, it must be fully accessible in the camp. And it must be available while the work is happening, not years later. Storing project data in specialized online archives is fundamental, too, but serves mainly other purposes that have very often little to do with the communities that produced the data**. 

To make this possible, we are exploring [Internet-In-A-Box](https://github.com/langdoc-minawao/IIAB) and other local, offline tools. They allow project materials to be stored and accessed directly inside the camp, even without electricity and an internet connection. It’s a simple step, but one that helps build trust and ensures that our work genuinely serves the people who make it possible.
