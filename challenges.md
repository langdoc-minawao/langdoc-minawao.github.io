Ours is one of the very few, if any, projects of language documentation run in a refugee camp. More ample discussion of the specific challenges posed by such setting will be found in an upcoming publication, which will be referenced here. In this page, we focus on the two main challenges that we encountered, and the possible solutions that we are adopting to cope with them.

## Working in a context of acute lack of resources
At times of reduced humanitarian support and shrinking resources—such as the current context, marked by major cuts in international aid—the presence of Global North external actors in a refugee camp often becomes a practical obstacle to smooth documentary work. Outsiders inevitably introduce perturbations into the local environment and its constituting relationships. This can (and usually does) heighten tensions among project participants.

Although this challenge is not actually addressed in standard language documentation best practices, the only effective way to manage it is to minimize the outsider’s presence during the core documentary activities. Doing so requires a robust framework built on four pillars:
- **Meaningful capacity building among camp residents** enabling them to take full ownership of the documentary tasks.
- **Consistent and constructive communication within the team**.
- **Reliable technological infrastructure** ensuring seamless team-wide collaborative work even when some members are dispersed (e.g. see Tech page).
- **A clear, collectively endorsed team structure** with well-defined roles, responsibilities, rights, and transparent decision-making.

This is what genuine community collaboration looks like, and this is what we are doing in this project.

## Keeping project outputs local and accessible
Life in a refugee camp is marked by a deep lack—not only of resources, but of the social and cultural structures that normally hold communities together. People are separated from their traditions and often even from one another, scattered across different sectors of the camp. NGOs and institutions try to ease this vulnerability through an endless stream of projects, each with its own meetings, committees, and targets. Camps change constantly: projects start and stop, buildings appear and disappear, outside staff come and go.

**In this confusion, and with the root causes of displacement left untouched, most residents see little real change. Project results rarely stay in the camp or remain accessible once funding ends. Over time, this erodes trust and weakens any sense of future—especially for young people.**

This is exactly why the outputs of our project need to be returned to the community quickly and in ways that people can actually use. **If knowledge is collected in the camp, it must stay in the camp. And it must be available while the work is happening, not years later in some distant report or in a hard-to-search electronic archive on the internet**. 

To make this possible, we are exploring [Internet-In-A-Box](https://github.com/langdoc-minawao/IIAB) and other local, offline tools. They allow project materials to be stored and accessed directly inside the camp, even without a stable internet connection. It’s a simple step, but one that helps build trust and ensures that our work genuinely serves the people who make it possible.
